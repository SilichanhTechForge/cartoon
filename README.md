#Calculator Project
This is a simple calculator project built using F#.

#Project Structure
The project contains several important files and directories. The appsettings.Development.json and appsettings.json files are used for configuration settings, with the former being specific to the development environment. The bin and obj directories store compiled binaries and object files, respectively, and are generated automatically when the project is built.

The calculator.fsproj file is the project file, containing information about the project's configuration, including references to other packages and projects. The calculator.sln file is the solution file, which is used by the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to manage and build multiple projects together.

The Client.fs file is one of the source code files written in F#. The Properties directory contains project properties, such as assembly information. The Startup.fs file usually contains the startup configuration for the application, including middleware and routing configurations. The style.css file is a stylesheet used to define the look and feel of the application's UI. The wsconfig.json file might contain configuration settings related to web services. Finally, the wwwroot directory is typically used to serve static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
